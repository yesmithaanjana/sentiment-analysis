# sentiment-analysis
Introduction


In the era of digital communication, people express their thoughts and opinions across various platforms such as social media, product reviews, and blogs. With the exponential growth of user-generated content, it becomes increasingly challenging to manually interpret and extract useful insights from large volumes of textual data. Sentiment Analysis provides an effective solution by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify and categorize opinions expressed in text as positive, negative, or neutral.

This project aims to build a Sentiment Analysis System that processes textual data and determines the sentiment behind user-generated content. By analyzing the underlying emotions and opinions within the text, this system can be applied in areas such as customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and social media trend tracking.


Technologies and Tools Used


This project leverages the following tools and technologies:

Python: Core programming language used for text processing, data analysis, and model development

Pandas: For data loading, preprocessing, and manipulation of structured text data

NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and array handling

Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, including model training and evaluation

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)/spaCy: For natural language preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization

TF-IDF Vectorizer / CountVectorizer: For feature extraction and transforming text into numerical form

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization, exploration, and performance analysis

Jupyter Notebook: For writing, testing, and visualizing code in an interactive environment

Data Descriptions


All the features in the dataset used for sentiment analysis are defined as follows:

text : The user-generated content (e.g., a tweet, product review, or comment) to be analyzed for sentiment

sentiment : The label indicating the sentiment of the text (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral)

id : A unique identifier for each text entry

timestamp (optional) : The date and time when the text was posted (useful for trend analysis)

user/location (optional) : Metadata related to the user or origin of the content (used for geographical or user-based analysis)

Additional preprocessed features may include:

cleaned_text : Text after preprocessing steps like lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword elimination

tokens : List of words extracted from the cleaned text

lemmatized_text : The normalized form of the text, where each word is reduced to its root form
